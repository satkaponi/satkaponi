Financial market regulators have made it mandatory to get certification before becoming a Mutual Fund distributor. Our client, who is largest Asset Management Company in India, wants to help distributors learn easily, in an interactive manner, through digital means.
We have co-developed a digital course which covers the entire content, through the use of explainer videos, interactive learning elements, and activities, which makes learning easy for users.
